# FRCS: FIRST Robotics Competition Scouting

## What is FRCS?
- Throughout a competition, FIRST Robotics teams often "scout" other teams by gathering data on different aspects of the game.
- The data is then used to determie complementary teammates that would form a well rounded alliance for later stages of the compeition.
- FRCS is a crowd-sourced data collection platform meant to collect scouting data by all teams to streamline the scouting process and help all FRC teams.

## How to use

# About FRCS
The reason we made FRCS is because every year, teams build new scouting systems from
the ground up. This wastes time, resources, and is overall inefficient. The way we see it, teams
are all collecting data in a similar fashion to one another, why keep our data separate? This
data will soon be able to be averaged out to provide a more objective and comprehensive model.
With onsite data analytics it's the easiest and most logical next step in FRC scouting. We look
at all feedback submitted so if you think there's something missing we'll try our best to help
out
