                            <p id="text_p">The reason we made FRCS is because every year, teams build new scouting systems from the ground up. This wastes time, resources, and is overall inefficient. The way we see it, teams are all collecting data in a similar fashion to one another, why keep our data separate? This data can all be averaged out to provide a more objective and comprehensive model. With onsite data analytics and lots of customization options it's the easiest and most logical next step in FRC scouting. You can choose to view only your data, how you evaluate the data, the questions that are asked to your scouters... As well as this, we answer EVERY feedback request for the site, so if you think there's something missing we'll most likely implement it.<br><br>And just in case you want to analyze the site's global database (or the data you collected) in a way that we can't offer, you can download ALL the data in a CSV file. So even if you don't use our data analytics you still have a collection backend, and are helping teams globally by contributing to the data</p>

                            <h4 id="subtitle">The Nitty Gritty</h4>
                            <p id="text_p">Sure, lots of data available at a quick glance is great! But FRCS also enables you to view independent and comprehensible data on almost every aspect of the team. Keep track of data submissions, notes, scores and more. The data collected is automatically graphed into box plots, line graphs, pie charts, and tables. All of this detailed data is accessible from the Scouting Rankings page and the search bar!</p>
