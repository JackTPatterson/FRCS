# FRCS: FIRST Robotics Competition Scouting

## What is FRCS?
- Throughout a competition, FIRST Robotics teams often "scout" other teams by gathering data on different aspects of the game.
- The data is then used to determie complementary teammates that would form a well rounded alliance for later stages of the compeition.
- FRCS is a crowd-sourced data collection platform meant to collect scouting data by all teams to streamline the scouting process and help all FRC teams.
